# Transaction Generator Parameters
# ================================

[accounts]
# Number of client accounts to generate
count = 9500

[transactions]
# Minimum transactions per account
min_per_account = 50
# Maximum transactions per account
max_per_account = 350030

[amounts]
# Minimum transaction amount
min = 0.01
# Maximum transaction amount
max = 9999.9906
# Decimal precision (0-4)
precision = 4

[withdrawals]
# Probability of a withdrawal vs deposit (0.0 - 1.0)
# Higher values mean more withdrawals
probability = 0.4
# Probability that a withdrawal will attempt to overdraw (exceed available balance)
# These will fail during processing but test error handling
overdraw_probability = 0.2

[disputes]
# Probability that a deposit will be disputed (0.0 - 1.0)
probability = 0.05
# Of disputed transactions, probability of resolution vs chargeback
resolution_probability = 0.7
# Remaining (1 - resolution_probability) will be chargebacks

[output]
# Output file path (use "-" for stdout)
file = "generated_transactions.csv"
# Random seed for reproducibility (optional, comment out for random)
